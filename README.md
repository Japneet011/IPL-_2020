# IPL-_2020
I have used sql to analyze IPL 2020 data using Joins, CTEs, Window Functions, Aggregation Functions, Creating view, Creating user defined functions, Creating stored procedures
I have done analysis on batsman score, team win percentage, created scorecards to analyse teams, individual batsmans and bowlers, calculated percentage of how a batsman is scoring runs and many more expolitary analysis on 2020 season which helps the user to understand every particular detail about the dataset.
I have used 3 datasets Venue, Matches and Deliveries which are stored in CSV Files.
